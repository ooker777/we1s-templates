# we1s-templates

Repository for WE1S workspace templates and documentation.

This repository is organised as follows:

1. `dist`: The `.tar.gz` archives of the Workspace templates. Templates will normally be downloaded from the archive files in this folder.
2. `docs`: The built HTML for the Getting Started website. This site is viewable at [https://whatevery1says.github.io/we1s-templates/](https://whatevery1says.github.io/we1s-templates/).
3. `src`: The source files for both the Getting Started website (in the `docs` subfolder and the Workspace templates (in the `templates` subfolder). The documentation is generated with [Mkdocs](), using the content of `src/docs`. The built site is then transferred to the main `docs` folder for publication to GitHub pages.
