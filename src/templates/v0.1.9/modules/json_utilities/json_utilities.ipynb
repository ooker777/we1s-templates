The `value` is the value you are looking for in the field, and the `operator` is the method by which you will evaluate the value. Here are the possible operators: `<`, `<=`, `=` (or `==`), `!=` (meaning \"not equal to\"), `>`, `>=`, `contains`. The last will match any value anywhere in the field. For greater power, you can use `regex` as the `operator` and a regex pattern as the `value`.\n",
