    "# Collocation Metrics for Bi- and Trigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Collocation is another way of discussing co-occurrence; in natural language processing, the term \"collocation\" usually refers to phrases of two or more tokens that commonly occur together in a given context. You can use this notebook to understand how common certain bi- and trigrams are in your project. Generally speaking, the more tokens you have in your project, and the larger your project data is, the more meaningful these metrics will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a brief introduction to the concept of collocation in natural language processing and to some of the metrics used in this notebook, see <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nicharuch/collocations-identifying-phrases-that-act-like-individual-words-in-nlp-f58a93a2f84a\" target=\"_blank\">Collocations</a>. More in-depth explanations can be found in a <a href=\"https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/promo/colloc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NLP textbook chapter on collocations</a> and in Gerlof Bouma's <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Normalized-%28pointwise%29-mutual-information-in-Bouma/15218d9c029cbb903ae7c729b2c644c24994c201?p2df\" target=\"_blank\">Normalized (Pointwise) Mutual Information in Collocation Extraction</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook allows you to calculate five different collocation metrics:  1) Likelihood ratio; 2) Mutual information (MI) scores; 2) Pointwise mutual information (PMI) scores; 4) Student's t-test; and 5) Chi-squared test.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Important:</strong> Collocation metrics are only useful when you can tokenize on bi- and trigrams. Therefore, this notebook assumes your documents include full-text data, and that this data is stored as a string in the `content` field of each document (see the **Settings** cell).\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the NLTK package to build a custom tokenizer to tokenize project uni-, bi-, and trigrams. This tokenizer differs from the one used in the WE1S preprocessing pipeline. See the module's <a href=\"README.md\" target=\"_blank\">README.md</a> file for more information.\n",
