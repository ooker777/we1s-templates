## About This Module

This module is really a container for miscellaneous "helper" notebooks that can be used to interact with the data in the project. These notebooks should be more or less self-documenting, so there is no user guide here.

## Notebooks

- `clear_caches.ipynb`: Notebook to empty or delete files and folder, and to clear the output Jupyter notebooks.
- `zip_folder.ipynb`: Notebook to create a zip or tar.gz archive of any folder in the project.
