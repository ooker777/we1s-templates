    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis\" target=\"_blank\">pyLDAvis</a> is a port of the R LDAvis package for interactive topic model visualization by Carson Sievert and Kenny Shirley.\n",
    "\n",
    "pyLDAvis is designed to help users interpret the topics in a topic model by examining the relevance and salience of terms in topics. Once a pyLDAvis object has been generated, many of its properties can be inspected as in tabular form as a way to examine the model. However, the main output is a visualization of the relevance and salience of key terms to the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "pyLDAvis is not designed to use MALLET data out of the box. This notebook transforms the MALLET state file into the appropriate data formats before generating the visualization. The code is based on Jeri Wieringa's blog post <a href=\"http://jeriwieringa.com/2018/07/17/pyLDAviz-and-Mallet/\" target=\"_blank\">Using pyLDAvis with Mallet</a> and has been slightly altered and commented.\n",
